MesaLink is a memory-safe and OpenSSL-compatible TLS library.
MesaLink has been in production at Baidu with >10 million monthly active users.

**This is a special version of MesaLink distributed as a `openssl-sys`-like
crate on crates.io. CMake/Autotools is not necessary to build this crate. This
version uses [rustls](https://crates.io/crates/rustls) and
[webpki](https://crates.io/crates/rustls) on crates.io instead of our forks.**

## Feature highlights

 * **Memory safety**. MesaLink is impervious to bugs like Heartbleed and buffer
   overflows becuse it is written in Rust.
 * **Cross Platform**. Linux, macOS, Android, Windows; x86, x86_64, armv7,
   aarch64... you name it. MesaLink probably compiles for it.
 * **Modern Ciphersuites**. MesaLink uses the best ciphersuites including
   AES-GCM, Chacha20Poly1305, and elliptic-curve key exchange with perfect
   forward secrecy.
 * **TLS 1.3**. Eight years since TLS 1.2, the faster and more secure TLS standard, is now in Rustls and MesaLink.
 * **Blazing Fast**. X25519 key exchange, AES-NI support, no language runtime
   like Java/Go. MesaLink runs at full speed on your metal.
 * **Flexible Configuration**: MesaLink offers flexible configurations tailored
   to your needs. You can customize which ciphers and TLS versions are built-in.
 * **Transparent Replacement**. MesaLink provides OpenSSL-compatible C APIs.
   Want to use MesaLink in curl or Android? No problem.
 * **Production Ready**. Baidu uses MesaLink in production with 10M monthly
   active users as of 12/2018

MesaLink depends on two Rust crates: [rustls](https://github.com/ctz/rustls) and
[sct](https://github.com/ctz/sct.rs). With them, MesaLink provides the following
features that are considered secure for most use cases:

* TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3
* ECDSA and RSA server authentication
* Forced hostname validation
* Forward secrecy using ECDHE; with curve25519, nistp256 or nistp384 curves.
* Safe and fast crypto primitives from BoringSSL
* AES-128-GCM, AES-256-GCM and Chacha20-Poly1305 bulk encryption
* Built-in Mozilla's CA root certificates

## Supported ciphersuites

* TLS13-CHACHA20-POLY1305-SHA256
* TLS13-AES-256-GCM-SHA384
* TLS13-AES-128-GCM_SHA256
* TLS-ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-CHACHA20-POLY1305-SHA256
* TLS-ECDHE-RSA-WITH-CHACHA20-POLY1305-SHA256
* TLS-ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-AES-256-GCM-SHA384
* TLS-ECDHE-ECDSA-WITH-AES-128-GCM-SHA256
* TLS-ECDHE-RSA-WITH-AES-256-GCM-SHA384
* TLS-ECDHE-RSA-WITH-AES-128-GCM-SHA256

## Unit tests
MesaLink uses cargo for unit tests. Simply run `cargo test`.

```
$ cargo test
```

## BoringSSL SSL tests
[BoGo](https://github.com/google/boringssl/tree/master/ssl/test) is BoringSSL's
protocol level test suite. We have ported BoGo for testing the functionality and
compatibility of MesaLink. To run BoGo test cases, run the following:

```
$ cd bogo && ./runme
```
